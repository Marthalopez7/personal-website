                <p>The Last of Us is a video game series that takes place during an apocalypse. There are currently two parts to this game and it has easily become my top favorite game. In the first game, we follow Joel as he encounters a young girl named Ellie who is immune to the bite of an infected. Together they set out to find the fireflies in hopes of finding a cure. This story has amazing visuals, gameplay, and music. However, my favorite part of the game is the beautiful story that unfolds as you play the game, with moments that you only wish you could play again for the first time.</p>

                <p>Subnautica is an underwater game that takes place on an alien planet. After your spaceship crashes on an alien planet, you are forced to find a way to survive until you find a way off the planet. This game provides a mixture of suspense, horror, and fun. This gameâ€™s unique characters and storyline are my favorite aspects of the game.</p>

                <p>Horizon Zero Dawn is the first part of a two part video game. The story takes place in the future after the current world is destroyed and humans revert back to a more tribal group. The story follows Aloy, an outcast, and her journey around the world trying to figure out her past. This game really took some concepts I had never seen before and blended them into one game. As of right now, I have finished both games Horizon Forbidden West and Zero Dawn and I can say that I enjoyed Horizon Zero Dawn more.</p>
